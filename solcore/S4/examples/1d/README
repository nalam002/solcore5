The file binary_grating.lua calculates the transmission spectrum of a
binary grating (50% duty cycle) composed of square rods. The frequency
range is chosen below the diffraction limit.

Run this example by executing:
$ S4 binary_grating.lua > out.txt
The output of this script should be similar to binary_grating.txt

Similarly, diffraction.lua calculates the diffraction efficiency for
the same structure at higher frequencies. Run it by executing:
$ S4 diffraction.lua > out.txt
The output of this script should be similar to diffraction.txt
