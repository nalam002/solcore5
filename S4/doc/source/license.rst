Specific components

The files ``cubature.c`` and ``cubature.h`` were taken from Stephen G. Johnson's `Cubature package <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature>`_. See the page for details.

The files ``sort.c`` and ``sort.h`` were taken from Rusty Russell's modification of the original libc routines. See the `CCAN page <http://ccodearchive.net/info/asort.html>`_ for details.

The file ``predicates.c`` is public domain, written by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk. See the `Quake project page <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html>`_ for details.

As a clarification, we should note that Lua script (.lua) files, written by the user (i.e. not containing code distributed with |S4|) and loaded at runtime by the |S4| software, are not considered derived works of |S4| and do not fall thereby under the restrictions of the GNU General Public License.

In addition, all of the example Lua code in these pages, as well as the example Lua files in the ``examples/`` directory, may be freely used, modified, and redistributed, without any restrictions. (The warranty disclaimer still applies, of course.)
