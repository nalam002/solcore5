How to cite
===========

We kindly ask that you reference the |S4| package and its authors in any publication for which you used it.
This is obviously neither legally binding nor enforceable, but we hope that you do.

The preferred citation for |S4| is the following paper:

    Victor Liu and Shanhui Fan, "|S4|: A free electromagnetic solver for layered periodic structures," Computer Physics Communications **183**, 2233-2244 (2012)
	`http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.04.026 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.04.026>`_

Or, in BibTeX format::

	@article{Liu20122233,
		author = "Victor Liu and Shanhui Fan",
		title = "S$^4$ : A free electromagnetic solver for layered periodic structures",
		journal = "Computer Physics Communications",
		volume = "183",
		number = "10",
		pages = "2233 - 2244",
		year = "2012",
		issn = "0010-4655",
		doi = "10.1016/j.cpc.2012.04.026",
		url = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465512001658",
	}

It is not absolutely necessary for the "4" in |S4| to be a superscript, but it is more correct if it is.
A brief description of the algorithm might be:

	The transmission spectrum was computed using the Fourier Modal Method using a freely available software package [ref]. 

.. |S4| replace:: S\ :sup:`4`
